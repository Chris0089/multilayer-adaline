####  Adaline ###
	Is a linear decision boundary.
	Stochastic gradient descent learning.
	Continuous response.
	Weight training: W * eta * (d-y) * x
	
	## Gradient descent ##
		Iterative Optimization Algorithm
		Used to find local minimum of a function
		
		If the multi-variable function is DEFINED and DIFFERENTIABLE 
		

		
### Regression ###
	Statistical modeling.
	Estimates the relationship among variables.
	Used for prediction and forecasting.
	Overlapping with machine learning.
	
	Common paramethric methods:
		> Linear regression.
		> Ordinary least Squares.
	These've FINITE UNKNOWN parameters estimated from the data.
		
		# Linear regression #
			Single Linear Regression: One variable
			
			 * Conditional expectation  or Conditional mean*
				Probability theory field.
				One value will take some "average" if some set of conditions occur.
				When the random variable is defined over a discrete probability space, the conditions are a partition of this probability space.
				
				Generalizes to any probability space using measure theory.
				
				
				
				
		
	
	## Nonparametric regression. ##
		These NEED larger samples because their model structure must be developed by the data.
		
		Some methods:
			> Gaussian process regression or Kriging.
			> Kernel regression.
